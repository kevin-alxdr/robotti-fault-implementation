# Robotti Fault Diagnosis and Debugging  
This project, developed as part of the university module CSC3634, involves the **Robotti agricultural robot**, where the main task was to **introduce a fault, diagnose it, implement a fix, and document the process**. The aim was to practice **debugging, model verification, and technical reporting skills** within a robotics and simulation context.

## Technologies & Tools
- **Modeling:** INTO-CPS  
- **Programming / Scripting:** VDM-RT  
- **Version Control:** Git / GitHub  
- **Documentation:** PDF

## Key Tasks
1. **Fault Implementation:** Introduced a deliberate fault into Robottiâ€™s system.  
2. **Fault Diagnosis:** Used debugging techniques and model-checking to identify the issue.  
3. **Fault Fix:** Corrected the fault and verified system behavior.  
4. **Reporting:** Documented the process, analysis, and outcomes in `report.pdf`.

## Learning Outcomes
- Strengthened skills in **debugging complex systems**.  
- Gained experience in **working with robotic simulation models**.  
- Learned to **document technical processes professionally**.  

## How to Use
- Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kevin-alxdr/robotti-fault-diagnosis.git
